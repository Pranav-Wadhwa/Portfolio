We all want to spend more time looking at the car rather than having to negotiate prices with the car dealership sales people for hours on end.<br><br>We decided to create an app where people don’t have to go through this time-consuming process, focusing on creating a better user experience than one from a car dealership. <b>Car Flex is an iOS app that uses augmented reality to allow users to immerse themselves in a 3D car model.</b>`

I used Apple's ARKit to show 3D models of various cars in a user's real environment. <b>Through this, I was able to create a functional, AR-powered iOS app that can improve the car-buying experience.</b>`
