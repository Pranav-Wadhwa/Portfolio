We need something to help us make the right decisions.<br><br>Gerta Malaj came up with the idea for <b>Delfi, a mobile app that guides you through a detailed decision making process and gives you specific feedback about potential faults in your choices.</b>`

            "During his work, Pranav showed several outstanding qualities. Not only did he deliver on what he was asked, but he went above and beyond, surpassing the requirements. He proactively thought and developed features that I had not mentioned or asked for but that were necessary, and even ones that would improve the product beyond the basics. Pranav is very detail-oriented and he ensured that we were thoughtful about every element, no matter the level of apparent significance...
            <br><br>
            It has been an honor to work with Pranav. Not only would his professional skills and experiences add immeasurably to any work environment, but his social skills would as well. Pranav is very generous, he is truly tactful in his communication, and he has a positive sense of humor. I am truly excited to see the things that Pranav will accomplish.
