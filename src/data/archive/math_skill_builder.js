      body: `While preparing for the rigorous entrance exam for a magnet high school, I realized that <b>I needed to be able to do basic math operations quickly.</b> I decided to use my newly formed iOS development knowledge to create a game that can drill these skills. 
            <br><br>
            <b>As my first commercial app</b>, Math Skill Builder took weeks of development not only to power the game logic but also to provide a user-friendly interface. I was excited to see my work on the App Store and thrilled that within a day, over 100 people had downloaded it and began playing. <b>Since its publication in 2015, Math Skill Builder has helped over 3,400 people worldwide improve their basic math skills.</b> This experience made me realize that I want to continue making amazing solutions that can help people across the globe.`
