            As a freelancer, I was tasked with creating UX flows, designing the UI, and programming the full iOS app using SimpL developers' machine learning. I created the flows and designs using Sketch and implented these using SwiftUI. I then created a custom camera view within the app that captured each frame of user motioned and gave auditory and visual feedback using SimpL's ML and data analysis. I also connected the app to Firebase authentication and realtime database to allow users to create accounts and save workout routines. Finally, I helped SimpL's team publish the app to the App Store, where it has received hundreds of downloads and dozens of 5-star reviews.
