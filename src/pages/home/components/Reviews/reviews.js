        "I cannot recommend Pranav more highly. He is truly one of the best people I've had the pleasure of working with. I was Pranav's manager during Summer 2020 when he worked as a Software Engineering Intern at wagr. Pranav is exemplary both as an individual contributor and as a teammate. He designed and developed multiple key features in record time, and was always proactive… <b>If you're a company reading this -- do not get fooled by Pranav's age.</b> He is advanced beyond his years and is more professional, knowledgeable, and driven than many with years of experience… I look forward to seeing everything he will continue to accomplish. If you have the good fortune to have Pranav on your team - you are one of the lucky ones!",

        "My co-founder Caroline and I are so lucky to have been introduced to Pranav. Within two weeks of our first discussion, he was able to create the exact program that we were looking for. He is incredibly responsive and responsible. Not only did he quickly design a new website according to our needs, but he is also still available at a moment's notice to help with any malfunctions. Since the relaunch of our website (with Pranav's additions) we have received many compliments and inquires about who our skilled programmer is. Needless to say, everyone is impressed by his work. We couldn't be more thankful for his help!",

        "During his work, Pranav showed several outstanding qualities. Not only did he deliver on what he was asked, but he went above and beyond, surpassing the requirements. He proactively thought and developed features that I had not mentioned or asked for but that were necessary, and even ones that would improve the product beyond the basics. Pranav is very detail-oriented and he ensured that we were thoughtful about every element, no matter the level of apparent significance. Not only would his professional skills and experiences add immeasurably to any work environment, but his social skills would as well. Pranav is very generous, he is truly tactful in his communication, and he has a positive sense of humor. I am truly excited to see the things that Pranav will accomplish.",

        "Pranav created a quiz and web design for my company getactingpeople.com The quiz he created is very user friendly and displays results immediately. Pranav is extremely professional, prompt to respond, assists whenever needed and answers any questions or help. Pranav was a pleasure to work with, he is friendly, intelligent, easy to communicate with, explains everything thoroughly and understandably to non-computer scientists . We are extremely grateful for all his help and our company would not be where we are today without Pranav. Even after our project ended, he was open to providing support when needed. We hope to work with Pranav again in the future.",
